		<h3><strong>Definition</strong></h3>
			<p align="justify">Open Game is a chess opening with the moves: 1.e4 e5. Whites aim here by playing 1.e4 is to open up the game by unblocking the diagonals for both queen and kingside bishop. On the opposite side, the blacks aim here is to also open up the diagonals for both queen and kingside bishop, and to attack the d4 square which is not safe for the d-pawn to move unless white choose to gambit it.</p>
			<p align="justify">The term Open Game is used because, in this kind of opening, both players don’t use their entire pawns to gain early advantages, unlike Closed Game, both players need the entire pawns and pawn pushes to play for the center. So in the Open Game, the bishops are more needed than the knight because bishops can control the open lines. However, knights are more needed in the Closed Game because knights can easily jump over other pieces, which bishops can't do.</p>
			<br>
		<h3><strong>Main Openings</strong></h3>
			<p align="justify">In the Open Game, you must be wise from playing chess, because if you don’t, your opponent can take initiative by playing its best moves and ultimately gain any types of advantages. So the lists below are the main openings (variations not included). So if you want to know what are the common continuations and variations of any openings, just wait for it until I write it as soon as possible. Anyways, I no longer include unimportant and unusual openings, because it is not recommended for the tournaments, online, and live chess that makes your game worsen or even worst.</p>

			<p align="center"><strong>Bishop's Opening</strong></p>
			<p>1.e4 e5
			<br>
			2.Bc4</p>
			<p align="justify">Bishop’s Opening is one of the rarely played openings in chess. Its main idea is to develop the bishop in the open lines; it also attacks the weakest f7-pawn and prevents black from playing d7-d5. But the only problem is that white didn’t attack or exert pressure on the e5 pawn. The e5 pawn can be defended easily and it is hard to get this pawn immediately.</p>

			<p align="center"><strong>Center Game</strong></p>
			<p>1.e4 e5
			<br>
			2.d4</p>
			<p align="justify">In the Center Game, white opens up the diagonal for both two bishops by sacrificing the pawn, gaining a space advantage. Black naturally captures the d4 pawn, or else the d4 pawn will capture it. Here, the white queen can recapture the d4 pawn, but it gives the black knight with a tempo move to attack the queen. Now, black has a development advantage but if you look carefully, white can easily develop all its pieces without any obstacles.</p>

			<p align="center"><strong>Four Knights Game</strong></p>
			<p>1.e4 e5
			<br>
			2.Nf3 Nc6
			<br>
			3.Nc3 Nf6</p>
			<p>In the Four Knights Game, it follows the beginners rule “knights before bishops” which means that the development of knights is more important than bishops.<sup style="font-size:11">[1]</sup> These Knights are the first pieces to control the center but like what I say the bishops are more important in the open game. In the other games, knights can be pinned by bishops to either king or queen and these knights cannot use anymore. So in this opening, you must be careful that your knights are safe from the pin.</p>

			<p align="center"><strong>Italian Game</strong></p>
			<p>1.e4 e5
			<br>
			2.Nf3 Nc6
			<br>
			3.Bc4</p>
			<p>Its main purpose is to attack the f7 pawn with the bishop and to prevent white from playing d7-d5. Another thing is that white is ready to castle on the kingside. From here, black has many ways of its continuation. He can go for 3…Bb5, with the same reason as white, or 3…Nf6 attacking white pawn and securing the d5 square, or he can go for 3…Be7, attacking the dangerous g5 square, preventing whites’ knight to jump closer to the king.</p>

			<p align="center"><strong>King's Gambit</strong></p>
			<p>1.e4 e5
			<br>
			2.f4</p>
			<p>Its main purpose is to exert pressure on the e5 pawn to establish a great central control and opening up the file for the rook.<sup style="font-size:11">[2]</sup> But my opinion here is that it exposes the white king and it breaks the good form of the pawn structure, or else the player wants to take a risk. Bobby Fischer plays this many times but Spassky used this to destroy him.</p>

			<p align="center"><strong>Petrov's Defense</strong></p>
			<p>1.e4 e5
			<br>
			2.Nf3 Nf6</p>
			<p>Instead of defending the e5 pawn, black offers the e-pawn but it also attacks the whites’ e-pawn. If you look at the first time you saw it, it looks like a funny opening because of black copies of all your moves. But for me, I don’t want to call it a defense because of knight defense what?</p>

				</center>
			<p align="center"><strong>Philidor Defense</strong></p>
			<p>1.e4 e5
			<br>
			2.Nf3 d6</p>
			<p>Its main idea of playing pawn to d6 is to defend the other pawn against the knight. But this pawn blocks the long diagonal on its bishop, but it not absolutely hampers it because there is one diagonal left for it to move. And also it gives white a space advantage because it controls many squares than the black.</p>

			<p align="center"><strong>Ruy Lopez Opening</strong></p>
			<p>1.e4 e5
			<br>
			2.Nf3 Nc6
			<br>
			3.Bb5</p>
			<p>In this opening white exerts another pressure on the e5 pawn by attacking its defender, the knight on c6. If the bishop captures the knight, then the e5 pawn loses defender and it can capture by the knight on the following moves. So for black, he must be careful on his next move, or else he will lose a pawn.</p>

				</center>
			<p align="center"><strong>Scotch Game</strong></p>
			<p>1.e4 e5
			<br>
			2.Nf3 Nc6
			<br>
			3.d4</p>
			<p>Its main idea is like Center Game, white opens up the diagonal for both two bishops by sacrificing the pawn, gaining a space advantage. Here, instead of queen recapture pawn, you have knight joining the action and attacking the other knight sitting on the c6 square.</p>
			<br>

				</center>
			<p align="center"><strong>Three Knights Opening</strong></p>
			<p>1.e4 e5
			<br>
			2.Nf3 Nc6
			<br>
			3.Nc3</p>
			<p>Its main idea is to develop the knight and at the same time defending the e4 pawn and attacking the d5 square. Its most common continuation is the Four Knights Game written above.</p>
			<br>

				<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c8/00/3d/c8003de7266edb05dde6369e83766b0f.png" alt="Vienna Game" height="200" width="200">
				</center>
			<p align="center"><strong>Vienna Game</strong></p>
			<p>1.e4 e5
			<br>
			2.Nc3</p>
			<p>Instead of the regular Nf3 move, the other players want to play the Nc3 move, leaving the other moves like Bc4. Its other idea is that the knight attacks the d5 square and defending the e4 square if black attacks it.</p>
